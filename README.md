# Torjus' Neovim Configuration

My personal, messy Neovim config forked from [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim). It's evolved into something quite specific to my workflow and probably broken in places. You probably don't want to use this directly - consider starting with the original kickstart.nvim or a mature distribution like LazyVim instead.
